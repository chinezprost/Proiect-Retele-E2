# **Collaborative Notepad - Networking Project**

The chosen project represents a client-server application that allows simultaneous editing of text files. The server must implement the simultaneous creation of multiple "rooms" to which at most two clients can connect, and which can process text files simultaneously. Each client has the possibility to save the previously created file on the server in the database and to download it later.
